NAME
----
fbautostart - Autostart all XDG applications

SYNOPSIS
--------
*fbautostart* ['options']

DESCRIPTION
-----------
*fbautostart(1)* is an XDG complaint startup tool. This will
go through the directories set up by the spec, and start all
applications that match it's compiled identifier.

This tool has almost no dependencies and was written to be smart
about this sort of stuff. There is a greater then average chance
that you will find a bug, since it is a from-scratch implementation.
Pleas report bugs.

FILES
-----
*~/.config/autostart*::
	This folder contains the default user XDG dot-desktop files that
        will be run ( unless it's overridden )

*/etc/xdg*::
	This folder contains the default system XDG dot-desktop files that
        will be run ( unless it's overridden )


OPTIONS
-------
*--noexec*::
	Do not execute any of the files,
	rather, display what would have been run

*--window-manager* ['WMNAME']::
	Override the compile-time default window
	manager, and work on behalf of this instead.
	This is helpful if you'd like to use this tool in
	place of another DE's normal XDG Autostarting
	application
