NAME
----
fbautostart - Autostart all XDG applications

SYNOPSIS
--------
*fbautostart* ['options']

DESCRIPTION
-----------
*fbautostart(1)* is an XDG complaint startup tool. This will
go through the directories set up by the spec, and start all
applications that match it's complied identifier.

This tool has almost no dependencies and was written to be smart
about this sort of stuff. There is a greater then average chance
that you will find a bug, since it is a from-scratch implementation.
Pleas report bugs.
