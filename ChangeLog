* src/xdg_parse.cc(parse_folder): Adjusted this function to only parse
.desktop files. This closes bug #1 on Github. Thanks, confluence.
* src/xdg_parse.cc(ends_with): Added this function.
* Changed all the headers to show my fluxbox email rather then no email.
* Added documentation blocks to all non-straight forward routines. I'm tired
of not remembering what my old code does :)
* Added a HACKING document to help people work on the code (or myself).

* Re-indenteded all the files to use spaces rather then tabs.
* Added some documentation on what the FB_EXEC flag does.

* Merged with test code I've been tracking.
* Upstream version bump to version  2.718281.
* Basically, we've moved to a state-based parsing
model (without ragel, since ragel sucks ass, I don't
care what ak|ra thinks -- in the nicest way I can say
it).

* Removed the #define for the window manager setting in
include/fbautostart.h. It's now a const char, and dynamic
with the new --window-manager flag.
* Changed fbautostart to error out when you pass in a bum
flag. This caused me great pain the other day. Fixed now.
* Forgot to bump the version number. It's now version 2.71828.
Both of these changes were in src/fbautostart.cpp

* Bugfixes for random crap for XDG env issues.
This is a fix for issues that I missed when fixing
Segaja's issues.

* Bugfixes for random crap. Rewrote stuff to make
more sense.

* Fixed a bug with env vars. Thanks, Segaja.

2010-10-14  Paul Tagliamonte  <paultag@ubuntu.com>
